# Next.js Project Setup and Basics
This repository serves as the initial setup phase for a comprehensive web development project using modern tools. The primary goal is to establish a robust foundation for building interactive and scalable web applications.

We'll be configuring and learning how to integrate the following core technologies:

1. Next.js (Pages Router): For routing, server-side rendering, and project structure.

2. TypeScript: To ensure strong typing, enhance code quality, and catch errors early.

3. Tailwind CSS: For utility-first styling, enabling rapid, responsive UI development.

This setup prepares the environment for the subsequent development of reusable components, API integration, and modular pages.
